Input: Array of integers

Output:
1) Each integer in the array
2) All factors of the integer present in the array.

Example:
Input: [10, 5, 2, 20]
Output: {10: [5, 2], 5: [], 2: [], 20: [10,5,2]}

Additional Questions:

1.  What if you were to cache the calculation, for example in the file system.  What would an example implementation
of the cache look like?

By cache I mean, given an array input, skip the calculation of the output if you have already
calculated the output at least once already.

2.  What is the performance of your caching implementation?
Is there any way to make it more performant?

3.  What if you wanted to reverse the functionality?
Input: [10, 5, 2, 20]
Output: {10: [20], 5: [10,20], 2: [10, 20], 20: []}

Would this change your caching algorithim?

With caching, the output should be the same except the calculations are not performed.
