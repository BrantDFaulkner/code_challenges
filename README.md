###Code Challenges

This repository shows solutions I have designed, coded, and tested for various code challenges presented during the application process for a junior development position.

For each challenge, I used test/behavior driven development. I translated the stated objectives into standalone test files to affirm the program meets original specifications.

As always, I welcome and appreciate any constructive feedback.
